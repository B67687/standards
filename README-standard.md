# README Standard

## Section Order

```
1. Title (H1)
2. Badges (centered row — tech stack, license, AI attribution)
3. Short Description (≤120 chars, no heading, on its own line)
4. AI Attribution ("Built with AI assistance — see CREDITS.md")
5. Screenshots / Demo (apps only — near top)
6. Table of Contents (required if >100 lines)
7. Features / What It Does
8. Quick Start / Installation
9. Usage / Examples
10. Architecture (libraries/harnesses — with SVG diagram)
11. Contributing (required — state PR policy, where to ask questions)
12. Optional sections (any order): Development, Testing, API, Config, Privacy, FAQ
13. Changelog link ("See CHANGELOG.md")
14. License (ALWAYS LAST)
```

## Badge Header

Badges are centered `<img>` tags, placed directly under the title:

```html
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/badges/kotlin.svg" alt="Kotlin" />
  <img src="docs/badges/license.svg" alt="MIT" />
  <img src="docs/badges/deepseek.svg" alt="DeepSeek V4 Flash" />
  <br />
  <sub
    >Built with AI assistance — see <a href="./CREDITS.md">CREDITS.md</a></sub
  >
</p>
```

Badge SVGs live in `docs/badges/` and are generated via `scripts/generate-badge.sh`. All badges on the same line must be the same height (20px standard).

## Dark Mode

GitHub supports dark mode. Images in the README should work in both themes:

**For logos / brand images:** Use GitHub's `#gh-dark-mode-only` / `#gh-light-mode-only` URL fragments:

```markdown
![logo-light](docs/images/logo-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
![logo-dark](docs/images/logo-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)
```

**For architecture diagrams / screenshots:** Use the `<picture>` tag with `prefers-color-scheme`:

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/diagrams/arch-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/diagrams/arch-light.svg" alt="Architecture diagram">
</picture>
```

**For badges:** Most badge colors work on both backgrounds. No special handling needed.

## When to Split

If the README exceeds 300 lines, split content into separate files:

| File                | Content                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`         | On-ramp: description, badges, quick start, license |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md`   | Deep architecture, diagrams, design decisions      |
| `DEVELOPMENT.md`    | Build from source, testing, contributing           |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`   | How to contribute, code standards, PR workflow     |
| `CHANGELOG.md`      | Release history (Keep a Changelog format)          |
| `CREDITS.md`        | AI model attributions                              |
| `API.md`            | Full API reference                                 |
| `HARDWARE_GUIDE.md` | Hardware-specific validation (if applicable)       |

## GitHub-Sponsored Files

These files should exist at repo root alongside README.md (not inside it):

| File | Required? | Content |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `LICENSE` | ✅ Yes | MIT for public repos |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | ✅ Yes | PR policy, code standards, workflow |
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | 🟡 Recommended | Expected behavior, reporting |
| `SECURITY.md` | 🟡 Recommended | Vulnerability disclosure policy |

## Templates by Repo Type

### Harness / Framework (e.g. agentic-workflows)

```
Title → Badges → Description → AI Attribution →
Quick Start → Workflow / Features → Architecture →
Contributing → Changelog → License
```

Key features: CLI examples, workflow tree, configuration reference, ecosystem diagram.

### Library (e.g. ithmb-codec)

```
Title → Badges → Description → AI Attribution →
Install → Usage → Architecture → Build → Test →
Contributing → Changelog → License
```

Key features: code examples in multiple languages, tests count, SIMD/performance tables.

### Application (e.g. bus-hop)

```
Title → Badges → Description → AI Attribution →
Screenshots → Features → Download → Tech Stack →
Architecture → Contributing → License
```

Key features: screenshots near top, download links, privacy section.

## GitHub Alerts

Use GitHub-flavored markdown alerts for callouts. They render as colored boxes:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Key information that users should be aware of.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Information that is critical to understanding the project.

> [!WARNING]
> Content that has the potential to cause issues.

> [!CAUTION]
> Potential negative consequences of an action.
```

Use alerts sparingly — they lose impact if overused. One alert per section max.

## Image Paths

All images use relative paths under `docs/`:

```
docs/screenshots/   → screenshots
docs/badges/        → badges
docs/diagrams/      → SVG architecture diagrams
```

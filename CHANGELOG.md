# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Language Standard (American English): `docs/standards/language-standard.md` + `scripts/checks/language.sh` with 7 sub-checks (American spelling enforcement)
- ADR Standard: Added `**Last Reviewed:**` date field to template and `adr.sh` check 6 (6 checks total)
- Agent Evaluation Standard: New standard documenting LLM-as-judge methodology with bias mitigation strategies (position bias, verbosity bias, self-preference, calibration drift)
- `docs/standards/secrets-management-standard.md`: Added Gitleaks pre-commit hook recommendation section (`.pre-commit-config.yaml` and lefthook patterns)
- `docs/standards/repo-structure-standard.md`: Added Go-specific layout variant (`cmd/`, `pkg/`, `internal/`, `go.mod`)
- Self-Consistency meta-standard: standards repo must pass its own audit (`docs/standards/self-consistency-standard.md` + `scripts/checks/self-consistency.sh`)
- `Makefile` at repo root with `audit`, `shellcheck`, `check` targets
- `mise.toml` at repo root with tool version manifest
- Git Identity Security Standard: config-driven committer enforcement, SSH signing, useConfigOnly, gpgsign (7 checks)
- Safe Wrappers Standard: git-safe-commit/push/normalize, gh-safe-pr-create, gh-ensure-signed-rules (4 checks)
- `scripts/hooks/` — 4 canonical git hooks (pre-commit, prepare-commit-msg, commit-msg, pre-push) replacing old hardcoded global hooks
- `scripts/wrappers/` — 5 canonical safe wrapper scripts (config-driven, no hardcoded identity)
- `scripts/deploy-hooks.sh` — installs hooks from repo to `~/.config/git/ai-commit-hooks/`
- `scripts/deploy-wrappers.sh` — installs wrappers from repo to `~/.local/bin/`

### Changed

- `docs/standards/git-history-cleanup-standard.md`: Trimmed from 492 to 118 lines (removed CLI reference, linked to filter-repo docs)
- `docs/standards/repo-structure-standard.md`: Trimmed from 295 to 165 lines (removed full file lists, concise with examples)
- `docs/standards/ai-attribution-standard.md`: Trimmed from 289 to 140 lines (removed tutorial prose, focused on rules)
- `docs/standards/ci-pipeline-standard.md`: Trimmed from 276 to 130 lines (removed CI provider comparisons, linked to docs)
- `docs/standards/changelog-standard.md`: Trimmed from 253 to 140 lines (removed full keepachangelog.com excerpt, linked)
- `scripts/checks/lefthook.sh`: Now passes if `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists (alternative hook manager)
- `scripts/checks/trivy-secrets.sh`: Now passes if gitleaks is configured in hooks or CI (alternative secret scanner)
- `.gitignore`: Whitelisted `Makefile` and `mise.toml`
- `README.md`: Updated standards table (27 standards, 137 checks), fixed prose numbers
- `docs/badges/standards.svg`: Updated from 24 to 27
- `docs/badges/checks.svg`: Updated from 121 to 137
- `cross-repo-standards.md`: Added Self-Consistency to Future Candidates
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Added gitleaks secrets scanning step (was pre-commit only)

- All standard documents moved from root to `docs/standards/`; research/pattern docs to `docs/research/`
- Updated all cross-references across README, CHANGELOG, HANDOVER, and standard docs to reflect new paths

### Fixed

- `scripts/checks/commit-conventions.sh`: Aligned commit type regex with standard (10 types, removing `adopt|standardize|ci|build|style`)
- `scripts/hooks/commit-msg`: Aligned hook type set with standard (added `security`, `cleanup`; removed `ci`, `style`, `build`)
- `scripts/checks/cs-project-architecture.sh`: Added `set -euo pipefail` and `|| true` on `((var++))` arithmetic to prevent shell crash
- `scripts/checks/lefthook.sh`: Fixed `&>/dev/null` redirect suppressing `_check` output — wrapped in `bash -c`
- `scripts/checks/sops-secrets.sh`: Same redirect fix on sops and age binary checks
- `scripts/checks/self-consistency.sh`: Suppressed both stdout and stderr from inner audit (`>/dev/null 2>&1` instead of `2>/dev/null`)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Enforce `--exit-code` so CI fails on audit failures
- `scripts/checks/auto-commit-gitops.sh`: Added `SELF_CONSISTENCY_ACTIVE` guard for known self-consistency exception
- `.env.example` and `.env.encrypted`: Generated real 32-char hex APP_KEY (previously empty placeholder)
